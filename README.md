# Microsoft To Do MCP

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) service allows you to interact with Microsoft To Do tasks using an AI assistant.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm
- A Microsoft account
- Azure App Registration (see setup below)

### 2. Installation

There are two parts to installing this tool:
1. Installing the package
2. Setting up authentication (requires cloning the repository)

#### Step 1: Install the Package

```bash
npm install -g @jhirono/todomcp
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Authentication

Even if you install the package globally, you'll need to clone the repository to complete the authentication process:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhirono/todoMCP.git
cd todoMCP
npm install
```

### 3. Azure App Registration

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to "App registrations" and create a new registration
3. Name your application (e.g., "To Do MCP")
4. For "Supported account types", select one of the following based on your needs:
   - **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)** - For use within a single organization
   - **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)** - For use across multiple organizations
   - **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts** - For both work accounts and personal accounts
5. Set the Redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/callback`
6. After creating the app, go to "Certificates & secrets" and create a new client secret
7. Go to "API permissions" and add the following permissions:
   - Microsoft Graph > Delegated permissions:
     - Tasks.Read
     - Tasks.ReadWrite
     - User.Read
8. Click "Grant admin consent" for these permissions

### 4. Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following information:

```
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
TENANT_ID=your_tenant_setting
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
```

**TENANT_ID Options:**
- `organizations` - For multi-tenant organizational accounts (default if not specified)
- `consumers` - For personal Microsoft accounts only 
- `common` - For both organizational and personal accounts
- `your-specific-tenant-id` - For single-tenant configurations

**Examples:**
```
# For multi-tenant organizational accounts (default)
TENANT_ID=organizations

# For personal Microsoft accounts
TENANT_ID=consumers

# For both organizational and personal accounts
TENANT_ID=common

# For a specific organization tenant
TENANT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

## Usage

### Complete Workflow

1. **Authenticate to get tokens** (must be done from the cloned repository)
   ```bash
   npm run auth
   ```
   This will open a browser window for you to authenticate with Microsoft and create a `tokens.json` file.

2. **Create MCP config file** (must be done from the cloned repository)
   ```bash
   npm run create-config
   ```
   This creates an `mcp.json` file with your authentication tokens.

3. **Set up the global MCP configuration**
   ```bash
   # Copy the mcp.json file to your global Cursor configuration directory
   cp mcp.json ~/.cursor/mcp-servers.json
   ```
   
   This makes the Microsoft To Do MCP available across all your Cursor projects.

4. **Start using with your AI assistant**
   - In Cursor, you can now use Microsoft To Do commands directly in any project
   - Try commands like `auth status` or `list up todos` to get started

The Claude Desktop configuration file is located at:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` 
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

## Limitations

- The API requires proper authentication and permissions
- Rate limits may apply according to Microsoft's policies

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

- **"MailboxNotEnabledForRESTAPI" error**: This typically means you're using a personal Microsoft account. Microsoft To Do API access is limited for personal accounts through the Graph API.
  
- **Token acquisition failures**: Make sure your `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `TENANT_ID` are correct in your `.env` file.

- **Permission issues**: Ensure you have granted admin consent for the required permissions in your Azure App registration.

### Account Type Issues

- **Work/School Accounts**: These typically work best with the To Do API. Use `TENANT_ID=organizations` or your specific tenant ID.

- **Personal Accounts**: These have limited access to the To Do API. If you must use a personal account, try `TENANT_ID=consumers` or `TENANT_ID=common`.

### Checking Authentication Status

You can check your authentication status using the `auth-status` tool or by examining the expiration time in your tokens:

```bash
cat tokens.json | grep expiresAt
```

To convert the timestamp to a readable date:

```bash
date -r $(echo "$(cat tokens.json | grep expiresAt | cut -d ":" -f2 | cut -d "," -f1) / 1000" | bc)
```
